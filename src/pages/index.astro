      I am currently a neuroimaging research assistant at WashU working in the <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/ocean/" target="_blank" class="link link-primary">Organization for Cognitive, Emotional, and Attentional Neurodevelopment (OCEAN) Lab</a>. I graduated from UC Davis in 2022 with a major in Psychology and Communications, and obtained my Master of Science from Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine in 2024. Since college graduation, I have worked in multiple labs at Stanford and WashU investigating emotion and sensory processing in clinical samples using psychophysiology and neuroimaging methods. I am interested in studying the neurodevelopment of socio-emotional functions in children and how it relates to risk for psychopathologies. I use human neuroimaging, computational, and behavioral approaches to understand these questions.
